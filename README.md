# Movie API
This application was created to pull information from Rotten Tomatoes via Beautiful Soup and the Open Movie Database API in order to display it on a simple JS GUI. Python is used on the back end as a server to handle HTTP requests from the GUI. Python is also used to scrape Rotten Tomatoes and access the OMDB API. The resulting information is fed back to the JS front end.
